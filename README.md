# trajectory-thingy
Launch missiles through atmosphere and space on a spherical spinning Earth to hit a specified target. See the top of the .cpp file for technical details, and the "set some constants" section of the code is where you set coordinates, drag coefficient, etc.

Compile and run via the run.sh file (see comments at top of file for how to do this). This Bash script, run.sh, controls the overall flow of compiling, writing output files, and reading them into other programs. Linux is the natural OS for using a computer to compute, but, I thought it would be fun to give instructions in run.sh for how to run this "Linux style" code in macOS and even Windows.
